What are the chances of winning the lottery?

I created a javascript programme which runs multiple draws until a condition is met. One condition is until any combination of consecutive numbers is found, the other is until a predetermined set of numbers is found. The programme returns the number of draws which were run until the conditions were met. It is possible to set the tests to run multiple times which then returns an everage probability of winning. I created tests for both Lotto and Euromillions.
